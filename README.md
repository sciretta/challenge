# Challenge Application

This is a NestJS and MongoDB application that provides a GraphQL API for querying vehicles and their types. It uses data from an external API, stores it in MongoDB, and allows filtered querying of vehicle makes and types. This guide explains the setup, configuration, and how to run the project both locally and in production.

# Notes

- Every time a request is made with a specific currentPage and limit filter for first time to the server in general, not the user's first request but in general, this request can last more than 1 second since the data of the VehicleType collection it is saved as a new VehicleType is consulted, which means that when the vehicleType is in base the request will be made to the database which responds in times of up to 20 ms, that delay can be noticed by the first users who make requests but not by the rest of the users.
- I only made pipelines for linter and for the tests, I don't have a dockerhub account so it was difficult for me to upload my dochercompose to dockerhub registry, sorry for the inconvenience.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: 22.x or higher
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerized environment
- **Nest CLI** (optional, for local development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sciretta/challenge.git
   cd challenge
   npm install
   ```

2. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.

3. When running the server for first time you need to wait 40 seconds approximately to fill the initial data in the VehicleMakes and TypeMakeRelations collections.

---

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory for environment variables. The file should include:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase
   ```

2. The `docker-compose.yml` file configures MongoDB and the application containers. The app connects to MongoDB using the `mongo` service name.

3. The MongoDB configuration in the code uses the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable to establish the database connection.

---

## Local Development

To run the app locally with Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies locally**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start mongo container with**:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo
   ```

3. **Start server in dev mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Production Deployment

To deploy the application in production, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Variables**:

   - Configure `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file or directly on your production server environment to connect the application to MongoDB.

2. **Start Containers**:

   - On your production server, start the application with Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

3. **Log Monitoring**:
   - Verify that the containers are running properly with:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs -f
     ```

## Project Structure

The following describes the main files and directories in this project:

- **Dockerfile**: Specifies the steps to build the application container, including installing dependencies, the NestJS CLI, and building the production files.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the services required by Docker Compose, setting up both the application and MongoDB containers.

- **.env**: Contains environment variables used for configuring the application, such as `MONGODB_URI` for MongoDB connection.

- **src/**: Contains the main source code of the NestJS application, including modules, services, resolvers, and DTOs.

  - **src/modules/**: Houses feature-specific modules, such as `VehicleModule`, to keep related files organized.
  - **src/providers/**: Contains common services and database configurations used across modules.
  - **src/common/utils/**: Utility files, like XML parsers, that support the applicationâ€™s functionality.

- **dist/**: Contains the compiled JavaScript files after building the application with `npm run build`. This is the code executed in production.

This project structure supports a modular and maintainable application design, with well-organized source files and configuration settings.

## Testing

Here are some commands to run testing cases:

- **Without coverage**:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- **With coverage**:

  ```bash
  npm run test:cov
  ```

  To watch the coverage you can go to the following path

- **.\coverage\lcov-report\index.html**
